license</a>. Specifically, <code>chosen.css</code> is our own file, based on
the original chosen CSS but modified to work in the kwiki
layout. <code>chosen.jquery.js</code> is a straight copy. According to the MIT
license, this copy should include the MIT license text, however the text at
the top of the <code>chosen.jquery.js</code> file states that it should not be
editted. While this seems to be auto-generated verbage, we have chosen to
respect the clear imperative declaration and leave the file as is, relying
that the declaration and link to the MIT license in the file are deemed
sufficient by all parties.

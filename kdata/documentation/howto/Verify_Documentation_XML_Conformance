<div class="grid_12 blurbSummary">
  <div class="p">
    Kibbles documentation is generated from HTML snippets and / or HTML
    embedded in line with code, combined with thin processing logic and
    templates, to produce HTML5 pages. In order that these pages themselves be
    easily consumed as data input, it is important that all pages be XML
    compliant.

    <span data-todo="Implement this. There's a fair amount of planning
    remaining on all the details of how we want to handle testing. It's clear
    kibbles instances should be
    self-testing."><code>/self-test/kwiki/all-pages-are-valid-xml</code> will
    give the current status WRT to compliance on this issue.</span>
    Unfortunately, the built in parsers we currently use don't give great
    information on what the problem is. So far, the best solution to fixing
    compliance issues is to copy the source into an online 3rd party
    validator. We like
    the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> tool just fine.
